# Welcome to iona
Smart Home Server GNU+Linux
## What is it?!
This version of iona (known internally as "Feature-Complete Iona" or FCIona) is a GNU+Linux distro that will combine all the core features of the (eventually-to-be-released) iona-next (a combined OS+Hardware product with a custom gui yada yada)...

Basically this repo consists of the various iona modules that make up iona GNU+Linux. Iona will have the follow features:
- [x] Traditional DE (ex. KDE, Budgie, etc) w/ standard desktop apps (FireFox, etc)
- [x] Kodi
- [ ] Remotely accessible web UI
- [ ] Smart home automation (Smart Lights, Thermostats, all those things)
- [ ] Storage Server w/ SAMBA, Web UI, etc (with support for on-the-fly storage expansion)
- [ ] Voice Assistant (Alexa or something)
- [ ] AND MORE!!!

So yea... let's see how far this gets! :tada:
